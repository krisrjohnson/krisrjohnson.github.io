# Skills!
Through my past life as a data miner for comScore, I've cultivated a hybrid skillset of data science and data engineering, aka a __Data Mercenary__! Since the beginning of 2019 I've been working on Deep Learning with a focus on Computer Vision applications.

## Data Mercenary!
Technologies I've used heavily in a corporate environment and can use with infrequent google searches or stack overflow queries:
