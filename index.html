This is a personal website to post project work, deep learning write ups, and cheat sheets.

I'm currently working through the second half of fast.ai's [Practical Deep Learning for Coders](https://course.fast.ai/), [mlcourse.ai](https://mlcourse.ai), dipping into kaggle competitions, and [reading papers](/papers_read) with the goal of real world applicable Deep Learning and Computer Vision [skills](skills.html), which I'm exploring and furthering at a post-production VFX studio.

Previously finished first half of fast.ai and coursera's [deep learning](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) specialization, among others.
