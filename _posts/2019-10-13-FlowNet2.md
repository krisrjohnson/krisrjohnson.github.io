# FlowNet 2.0

arXiv [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.01925v1.pdf), Dec. 2016. FlowNet2.0 is a linear iteration of the original FlowNet resulting in greater accuracy that competes with traditional 'hard-coded' algorithms.

_"The large improvements in quality and speed are caused by three major contributions: first, we focus on the training data and show that the schedule of presenting data during training is very important. Second, we develop a stacked architecture that includes warping of the second image with intermediate optical flow. Third, we elaborate on small displacements by introducing a subnetwork specializing on small motions."_

## Summary of the original FlowNet

The idea of using CNNs to apply to Optical Flow is that CNNs learn underlying holistic image properties, such as classifying objects. These learnings can then in turn be used to identify how portions of the object move over frames, aka optical flow.

The original [FlowNet](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_iccv_2015/papers/Dosovitskiy_FlowNet_Learning_Optical_ICCV_2015_paper.pdf) by Dosovitskiy was an encoder decoder network. The encoder smashed two images down and then the decoder worked to spit out the optical flow differences. They created the flying synthetic chairs datasets to algorithmically produce large scale datasets.

"In this scope, we also found that the FlowNet version with an explicit correlation layer outperforms the version without such layer."
