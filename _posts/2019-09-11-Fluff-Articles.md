### Don't Let Metrics Undermine Your Business, [HBR](https://hbr.org/2019/09/dont-let-metrics-undermine-your-business)
Summary: Metrics aid in evaluating goal pursuit but are not the end all be all. Don't overoptimize to stated goalposts as you may ignore important red flags. __Surrogation__: the tendency to replace strategy with metrics.

Reminds me of Einstein quote, "Not everything that counts can be counted, and not everything that can be counted counts." Also reminds me of the maxim that every man-made system will be gamed, but in this context it's businesses doing it to themselves (well employees reacting to management)

"Surrogation is especially harmful when the metric and the strategy are poorly aligned."

"The real source of Wells Fargoâ€™s problems was measurement. When the bank decided to actively track daily cross-sales numbers, employees rationally responded by working to maximize them."
