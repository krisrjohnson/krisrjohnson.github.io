# Vision
Data Analytics, Project Management, and Deep Learning. Managed and developed large-scale, big data consumer web analytics products. Broadened software development and machine learning skills and transitioning further into the technology industry from market research.

I am currently specializing in Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence as applied to Computer Vision through fast.ai's [Practical Coding for Deep Learners](https://course.fast.ai/), Coursera's [Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) specialization, and O'Reilly's [Programming Computer Vision with Python](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-computer-vision/9781449341916/)


# Work Life
Currently applying Deep Learning models to VFX for a small production studio. Segmentation, style transfer, facial recognition, facial puppetry, whatever else could concievably use. Since the beginning of 2019 I've been working on Deep Learning with some Computer Vision thrown in! Through my past life as a data miner for comScore, I cultivated a hybrid skillset of data science and data engineering, a self dubbed __Data Mercenary__!
